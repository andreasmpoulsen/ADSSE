## 3

Which of the following sorting algorithms are stable: insertion sort, merge sort, heapsort, and quicksort? Give a simple scheme that makes any sorting algorithm stable. How much additional time and space does your scheme entail?

### Solution

INSERTION-SORT and MERGE-SORT are stable

## 4

Use induction to prove that radix sort works. Where does your proof need the assumption that the intermediate sort is stable?
